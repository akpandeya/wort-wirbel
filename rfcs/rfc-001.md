# RFC-001: Wort-Wirbel - Offline-First German Flashcard App

* **Author**: Wort-Wirbel Project
* **Status**: Proposed
* **Created**: 2025-08-30

---

## 1. Summary

This document outlines the design and architecture for **Wort-Wirbel**, a minimalist, offline-first web application for learning German vocabulary through spaced repetition flashcards. The initial version will focus on German-to-English translations and will operate entirely on the client-side after an initial data load, with no mandatory user accounts or server-side data storage for user progress.

---

## 2. Motivation

The goal is to create a language learning tool that is **simple**, **fast**, and **privacy-focused**. Many existing apps require an internet connection, complex account setups, or subscriptions. Wort-Wirbel aims to be an accessible alternative that works anywhere, anytime, giving users complete control over their data while using a proven method for vocabulary acquisition.

## 3. Core User Experience

The application's design is centered around three key user journeys.

### 3.1 The 'Willkommen' Experience (Onboarding)

The first-time user experience is designed to be frictionless and get the user learning within seconds.

1.  **Welcome Screen**: A single screen with the app's name and a "Let's Go!" button.
2.  **Invisible Setup**: Upon proceeding, the app downloads the initial word list (`words.json`) and sets up the local database in the background.
3.  **Interactive Tutorial**: The user is guided through a 3-5 card mini-lesson on basic words (*Hallo*, *Danke*, etc.). Tooltips explain the core actions ("Tap to flip," "Tell us how well you knew it") on the first card, after which the user proceeds on their own.
4.  **Completion**: A final screen confirms the setup is complete and transitions the user to the main app.

### 3.2 The 'Daily Wirbel' (Core Learning Loop)

This is the primary daily interaction for returning users.

1.  **Home Screen**: A minimalist dashboard displays a greeting, the number of cards due for review, the number of new cards available, and a visible streak counter (e.g., ðŸ”¥ 5-day streak). A single call-to-action button, "Start Your 'Wirbel'", begins the session.
2.  **Flashcard Interface**:
    * The front of the card displays the German word.
    * A tap flips the card with a smooth animation, revealing the English translation and a German example sentence for context.
    * Below the card, three self-assessment buttons appear: **[Again]**, **[Hard]**, and **[Good]**. The user's choice informs the spaced repetition algorithm for scheduling the next review.
3.  **Session Complete Screen**: Upon finishing the last card, a celebration screen appears with a positive message ("Super gemacht!"), a summary of cards reviewed and learned, and an updated streak counter.

### 3.3 Data Management & Control

Users have full control over their data via a dedicated **Settings** screen.

1.  **Sync Status**: A small, unobtrusive icon in the UI will indicate the app's data status (âœ… Synced, ðŸ”„ Syncing, ðŸ”Œ Offline). The app will automatically check for new word lists once a day or when manually triggered.
2.  **Backup & Restore**:
    * **Export**: A "Create Backup" button allows the user to save a `.json` file of their complete learning progress to their local device.
    * **Import**: A "Restore from Backup" button allows the user to select a backup `.json` file to restore their progress. A clear warning will be displayed to prevent accidental overwriting of current data.

## 4. Technical Design & Architecture

The technical stack is chosen for simplicity, performance, and future scalability.

### 4.1 Frontend Framework

* **Technology**: **Flutter** (with Dart).
* **Reasoning**: Chosen primarily for **future-proofing**. This allows the same codebase to be compiled into high-performance, native applications for iOS, Android, and desktop platforms if the project expands beyond the web.

### 4.2 Local Storage

* **Technology**: **IndexedDB**.
* **Reasoning**: As the native browser standard for client-side storage, it's perfect for an offline-first application. Its asynchronous API ensures the UI remains responsive, and it requires no external libraries.

### 4.3 Data Structure

* **Vocabulary**: Words and meanings will be stored in a static `words.json` file on the server. Words will be tagged by proficiency level (e.g., A1, A2, B1) to cater to different users.
* **User Progress**: The user's memorization status, review schedule, and ease factor for each word will be stored as objects in IndexedDB on the client's device.

### 4.4 Deployment

* **Platform**: **Render** (Static Site Hosting).
* **Reasoning**: Render provides a simple, Git-based continuous deployment workflow, a global CDN for fast load times, and a generous free tier suitable for this project's needs.

## 5. Future Considerations

This document covers the initial proof of concept. The following features are potential areas for future development:

* **Audio Pronunciation**: Adding text-to-speech or recorded audio for German words.
* **Iconography**: Finalizing a consistent icon set (e.g., from Material 3 Expressive).
* **Additional Languages**: Expanding the app to include other language pairs.
* **Optional Cloud Sync**: Implementing an opt-in service for syncing user progress across multiple devices.
